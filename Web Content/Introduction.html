Hello everyone. My name is Tuan Le but I also go by Ben. I am currently living in Columbia, Missouri. I am junior here at Mizzou and pursuing Educational studies & game design. My current goal is to become a game design. My interests and hobbies are playing soccer, listen to the music, travel, and play video games. The reason why I choose to be a game designs because I have interest on creating video games and I want to contribute to the game industry by provide my ideas and efforts to bring out many interesting games for the players. Additionally, I was planning to become a nurse because it has high salary and easy job opportunity seeking, however, due to the stress and intuition fee, also, nursing major was my mom suggestions because I do not know what I am going to be in the college; I realized I could pursue on the game industry because I am interested on creating my own game.
