        <h1 style="text-align: center;"> About</h1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>My name is Tuan Le, but I also go by Ben. I am currently living in Columbia, MO. I am a junior here at Mizzou and pursuing Educational Studies & Game Design. My current goal is to become a game designer.<br/>
        
        <p>My interests and hobbies are listen to music, play soccer, travel, and video games. The <em>reason</em> why I choose to be a video game designer because I have interest on <strong>creating</strong> video games and I want to contribute to the game industry by proving my <em>ideas</em> and efforts to bring out many interesing games for the player.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, I was planning to become a nurse because it has high salary and easy job opportunity seeking, however, due to the stress and intuition fee, also, nursing major was my mom suggestions because I do not know what I am going to be in the college; I realized I could pursue on the game industry because I am interested on creating my own game.</p>
         <p>My favorite quotes is:</p>
     <blockquote>"This is one small for a man, one giant leap for mankind" by Neil A. Armstrong</blockquote>
